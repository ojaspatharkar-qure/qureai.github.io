# Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) presents a global threat in the world and according to the recent [STOP TB report](https://www.stoptb.org/), TB deaths have increased for the first time in over a decade, an upward trend that is expected to worsen in 2021. For most patients, X-rays are the first diagnostic imaging step on their path to a definitive diagnosis of TB, which can save hundreds of lives if detected early. Therefore [FujiFilm](https://healthcaresolutions-us.fujifilm.com/) and Qure.ai have partnered to offer quality diagnostics to communities around the world.

>“This collaboration has enabled healthcare professionals to gain access to the best portable medical devices, which are equipped with superior AI technology to improve patient outcomes, reduce workloads and slash healthcare costs.” — Masaharu Morita, Global Head New Business, [FUJIFILM](https://healthcaresolutions-us.fujifilm.com/)
<br/>

FujiFilm’s portable X-ray (Xair) and Qure’s advanced AI technology (qXR) combine to diagnose TB from chest X-rays as soon as the scans are taken. Qure’s AI quickly triages normal cases and healthcare professionals can then focus on reading the abnormal X-rays that are indicative of TB.
<br/>

>“We have found Fuji’s vision to create and develop accessible and affordable solutions to align with our values. As such we have collaborated to provide our best-in-class software on a device to give immediate results for radiological signs of TB. This partnership will truly make healthcare more accessible and affordable.” — Prashant Warier, CEO and Co-founder, Qure.ai
